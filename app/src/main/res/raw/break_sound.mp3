# This is a placeholder file for the break completion sound
# In a real implementation, you would download or create an actual MP3 file
# For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent compilation errors
# You can replace this with an actual gentle chime sound file from:
# - freesound.org
# - zapsplat.com
# - or any royalty-free sound library
#
# The file should be a short (1-2 seconds) gentle chime or soft notification sound
# Format: MP3 or WAV
# Sample rate: 44.1kHz recommended
# Bit rate: 128kbps or higher
